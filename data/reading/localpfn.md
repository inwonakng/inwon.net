## Summary

While TabPFN shows great performance in certain circumstances, it does not scale well with larger datasets (quadratic memory). This paper proposes a method to improve the _context_ given to the PFN model by using a nearest-neighbors based approach.

## Approach

![Architecture](/static/images/reading/localpfn/architecture.png)

> [!image/Architecture]
> Description of the proposed architecture.
> a). Perform $k$NN for $x_{\text{qy}}$ in $\mathcal{D}_{\text{train}}$ as input to the TabPFN classifier.
> b). Use approximation of $k$NN (pre-computed by randomly selected points) to improve efficiency.

### Context from local data

> [!motivation]
> TabPFN is limited to randomly sampling the dataset when $\mathcal{D}_{\text{train}}$ is too large. This can lead to suboptimal performance. How can we optimize the context given to the TabPFN model?

Original TabPFN classification given $\mathcal{D}_{\text{train}} \triangleq \{(x^i_{\text{train}}, y^i_{\text{train}})\}_{i=1}^{N}$, $x^{i}_{\text{train}} \in \mathbb{R}^D$, $y^{i}_{\text{train}} \in \{1, ... , C\}$ and a query point $x_{\text{qy}}$:

$$
p_{\theta}(y_{\text{qy}} \mid x_{\text{qy}}, \mathcal{D}_{\text{context}}) = \cfrac{\exp(f_{\theta}(x_{\text{qy}}, \mathcal{D}_{\text{train}})[y_{\text{qy}}])}{\sum_{c=1}^{C} \exp(f_{\theta}(x_{\text{qy}}, \mathcal{D}_{\text{context}})[c])}
$$

using $[\cdot]$ as the indexing operator and $\mathcal{D}_{\text{context}} \triangleq \mathcal{D}_{\text{train}}$ (context is entire training dataset).

The proposed method, **LoCalPFN**, uses a $k$-nearest neighbors approach to improve the context given to the TabPFN model. Thus, $\mathcal{D}_{\text{context}} \triangleq k\text{NN}(x_{\text{qy}})$ is now a subset of $\mathcal{D}_{\text{train}}$.

### Improving efficiency for fine-tuning

> [!motivation]
> Original TabPFN takes input of shape $(B, L_{\text{ctx}} + L_{\text{qy}}, d)$ where $B$ is the batch size (set to 1 because there is only one context that is shared for every query point), $L_{\text{ctx}}$ is the number of context points, $L_{\text{qy}} = N_{\text{qy}}$ is the number of query points, and $d$ is the dimension of the input. But if we were to apply the above approach, we need to re-compute the $k$NN context for each query point, meaning the input now has shape $B = N_{\text{qy}}$, $L_{ctx} = k$, $L_{qy} = 1$. This can become very expensive for fine-tuning.

Instead, the authors propose to pre-compute the $k$NN context to approximate the exact process. If we want to fine-tune the model for $N_{\text{qy}}$ points, we start by selecting $B$ random points, compute their $k$NN context where $k = L_{\text{ctx}} + L_{\text{qy}}$, $L_{\text{qy}} = N_{\text{qy}} / B$, and store it. Then each $k$NN group can be split into query and context to fine-tune the TabPFN model. This way, we can ensure that the query points and context points are always _local_ to each other.

## Findings

### Limits of TabPFN/Benefit of local context

![Toy dataset comparison between TabPFN and LoCalPFN](/static/images/reading/localpfn/tabpfn-compare.png)

> [!image/Comarison between TabPFN and LocalPFN on a toy dataset]
> a). As the complexity/size of the dataset increases, vanilla TabPFN struggles.
> b). Using _local context_ as input instead of the whole training set improves performance.
> c). Performance vs. $k$. Large $k$ tends to "oversmooth" and suffer from high bias/underfitting, while small $k$ enables more complex decision boundaries but can suffer from more variance/overfitting.

### Experiments

> [!setting]
> 96 datasets from TabZilla[^1] benchmark suite.
> Main: TabPFN, TabPFN + $k$NN (No fine-tuning) and LocalPFN.

#### Dataset size/complexity

- TabPFN is already quite competitive in small datasets.
  - But LocalPFN improves (and upon TabPFN + $k$NN).
- LocalPFN can outperform other models in larger/more complex\* datasets.

#### Ablations

- Using both fine-tuning and $k$NN yields _best_ performance.
- $k$NN in the original space is already quite good. Using one-hot embedding further improves a bit.
  - But using the embeddings from the TabPFN encoder is _not as good_.
    > [!intuition]
    > Features values in tabular datasets can be semantically meaningful. Thus a distance metric that decomposes over individual features, i.e. $d(x, x') = \sum_{i} d(x_i, x_i')$ can be more effective than a learned distance metric.
- Using the local context is better than using the global context.
  - Instead of a single randomly-sampled context, compare against variations that try to use the full data for a *global* context.
    - Compared against random ensemble and ensemble with no overlap.
  - When not fine-tuning (TabPFN + $k$NN), $k$ does not matter as much. But when fine-tuning (LocalPFN), more $k$ can be better.
  - $k$NN is better than data distillation[^2]

\*: The authors define a proxy for complexity as the **difference between the lowest and highest performer**.
