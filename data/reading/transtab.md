## Summary

This work proposes a method to convert table rows into a sequence of token-embeddings similar to how NLP methods process text. This formulation allows for a more flexible usage of learned information from tables, such as transfer-learning, pre-train/fine-tune, incremental-learning or even zero-shot inference. This method shows superior performance compared to existing methods, and is widely adopted by following tabular works.

## Approach

> [!image/Overview of the approach]

### Input transformation

- **Categorical**: Column name + cell value (tokenized & embedded).
- **Continuous**: Column name (tokenized & embedded) \* cell value.
- Then stack everything into a _sequence_.

### Transformer backbone

Pretty much the same as vanilla transformer, but use a GLU (gated linear unit) instead of MLP for the FFN module. For layer $l$:

$$
\begin{gather}
\bf{Z}_{\text{att}}^l = \text{MHSA}(\bf{Z}^l) \\
\bf{Z}^{l+1} = \text{Linear}((\bf{g}^l \odot \bf{Z}_{\text{att}}^l) \oplus \text{Linear}(\bf{Z}^l))
\end{gather}
$$

where $\bf{g}^l = \sigma(\bf{Z}_{\text{att}}^l \bf{w}^G) \in [0,1]^n$ is a token-wise gating layer where $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function and $\odot$ is the element-wise product and $\oplus$ is the element-wise addition.

> [!Question]
> The authors say the gating is meant to _focus on important features by redistribution the attention on tokens_, but how that is actually achieved is not made very clear to me. Maybe this is just the point of the _gating mechanism_ and I'm not getting it?

### Vertical Partitioned Contrastive Learning (VPCL)

#### Self-Supervised VPCL

Given sample $\bf{x}_i = \{\bf{v}_i^1, ... , \bf{v}_i^K\}$ with $K$ partitions, use **partitions from the same sample** as positive and others as negative.

$$
\ell(\bf{X}) = - \sum \limits_{i=1}^{B} \sum \limits_{k=1}^{K} \sum \limits_{k'=1}^{K} \log \cfrac{\exp\phi(\bf{v}_i^k, \bf{v}_i^{k'})}{\sum_{j=1}^{B} \sum_{k^{\dagger}=1}^{K} \exp \phi(\bf{v}_i^k, \bf{v}_j^{k^{\dagger}})}
$$

where $B$ is the batch size, $\phi$ is the cosine similarity of the `[CLS]` embeddings of the partitions,

> [!intuition]
> We want the similarity of partitions from the _same_ sample to be higher ($\exp\phi(\bf{v}_i^k, \bf{v}_i^{k'})$), while keeping the similarity of partitions from _different_ samples low ($\exp \phi(\bf{v}_i^k, \bf{v}_j^{k^{\dagger}})$). I think the authors forgot to include $j \neq i$ when sampling the batches.

#### Supervised VPCL

> [!motivation]
> The authors argue that pre-training using task(dataset)-specific classifier heads with supervised loss is inadequate for transferrability, as it may cause the encoder to be biased to the major tasks and classes.

In addition, the authors propose a supervised contrastive-learning scheme inspired by Khosla et. al[^1], called Vertical Partitioned Contrastive Learning (VPCL).

$$
\ell (\bf{X}, \bf{y}) = - \sum \limits_{i=1}^{B} \sum \limits_{j=1}^{B} \sum \limits_{k=1}^{K} \sum \limits_{k'=1}^{K} \mathbf{1} \{y_j = y_i\} \log \cfrac{\exp \phi (\bf{v}_i^k, \bf{v}_j^{k'})}{\sum_{j^{\dagger}=1}^B \sum_{k^{\dagger}=1}^{K} \mathbf{1}\{y_{j^{\dagger}} \neq y_i\} \exp \phi(\bf{v}_i^k, \bf{v}_{j^{\dagger}}^{k^{\dagger}})}
$$

where $\bf{y} = \{y_i\}_i^{B}$ are batch labels and $\mathbf{1}\{\cdot\}$ is an indicator function (so any cases that do not meet the condition are zero-ed out).

> [!intuition]
> We want the similarity of partitions with the _same_ label to be higher ($\exp\phi(\bf{v}_i^k, \bf{v}_j^{k'})$), while keeping the similarity of partitions with _different_ labels low ($\exp \phi(\bf{v}_i^k, \bf{v}_{j^{\dagger}}^{k^{\dagger}})$).

## Findings

### Vanilla supervised setting

- Logistic regression is surprisingly strong.
- Aside from TransTab, only FT-Transformer shows competitive performance.
- TransTab is better than FT-Transformer in most cases.

### Incremental columns

> [!setting]
> Where the new data includes previously unseen columns. Baselines would need to either drop the old data or ignore the new columns.

- TransTab outperforms.

### Transfer learning

> [!setting]
> Split datasets into two sets with **some overlapping columns**. Baselines can train on just one and test on it. TransTab is pre-trained on one and fine-tuned/tested on the other.

- TransTab outperforms.
  - But not in all cases anymore! Why does XGB do better in one subset than TransTab? Is this splitting unintentionally doing some feature selection??

### Zero-shot inference

> [!setting]
> Split datasets into three sets with **no overlapping columns**. TransTab is trained on 2 of the sets and tested on other for zero-shot. Compare with train/test on just one set and pre-train on 2 sets, fine-tune/test on last set.

- Transfer shows best performance.
- Somehow zero-shot is better than supervised!
  - Since two-sets worth of columns is more *information* than just one set?

### VPCL vs. Vanilla supervised pre-training vs. Vanilla self-supervised pre-training

> [!setting]
> Compare against vanilla supervised, transferring with vanilla supervised, and VPCL (both self-supervised and supervised).

- Self-supervised VPCL shows better performance over supervised variant *when partition numbers increase*.
- Vanilla supervised transferring can sometimes even hurt performance (worse than just vanilla single-dataset setting).
  - Only on 5 datasets though.

> [!question]
> Is supervised-transfer same as "pre-training on supervised loss on other datasets"? Or is the model already pre-trained (maybe with VPCL) and is fine-tune/transferred for vanilla supervised setting?
